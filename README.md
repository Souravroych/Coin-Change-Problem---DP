# Coin-Change-Problem---DP

Consider the problem of making change for n cents using the fewest number of coins. Assume that each coin's value is an integer.

Describe a dynamic programming to make change consisting of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies and prove that your algorithm yields an optimal solution. Implement your algorithm and test your solution.
